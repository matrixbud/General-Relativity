# General-Relativity
Extensively annotated notes on Foster & Nightengale's text "A Short Course in General Relativity" as well as development of numerous related concepts.

This document is more like an instructor's manual since I try to fill in the many, many (intentionally) missing details that allowed the authors to keep their book compact and focused on the issues.

I have also extracted four or five topics that I present substantially differently from the book's approach, and I have included these as stand-alone files. In several cases these files consolidate material scattered across several chapters of the book. In each case, this material is interwoven into my book notes

One such topic is presentation of both the general Lorentz transformation matrix and the homogeneous Lorentz transformation matrix, which are not included in the text. Strangely, when properly presented I find the general matrices, especially the homogeneous one, to be much easier to understand and visualize than the specialized Lorentz transformation based upon an inertial frame moving in the x-direction, which is all that this book and many other present. Also, I have not found the homogeneous matrix mentioned elsewhere (I am sure it is) and I show how it can be used to simplify certain developments like the doppler formula for waves that are normally carried out with the more complex full matrix.

I found this text book to be the only one that I could read by myself to learn GR. I previously tried other several other texts but they all assumed too many facts and used mathematical notation that I didn't understand. I highly recommend this as a beginning text.
